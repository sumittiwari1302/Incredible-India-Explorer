# 📁 Project Structure

The project follows a **feature-based architecture**.

Every feature is self-contained inside its own folder under the **frontend** directory.

```
Incredible-India-Explorer/
│
├── frontend/
│   ├── feature-name/
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   ├── style.css
│   │   └── script.js
│   │
│   ├── another-feature/
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   ├── style.css
│   │   └── script.js
│   │
│   └── ...
│
├── assets/
├── .github/
├── README.md
└── CONTRIBUTING.md
```

---

# 🚨 Creating a New Feature

Every new feature **must** follow the project structure.

## Step 1

Create a folder inside `frontend`.

Example

```
frontend/state-capital-game/
```

---

## Step 2

Inside that folder create:

```
index.html
style.css
script.js
```

Final structure:

```
frontend/
└── state-capital-game/
    ├── index.html
    ├── style.css
    └── script.js
```

---

## ❌ Do NOT

Do **not** create files like

```
frontend/game.html
frontend/style.css
frontend/script.js
```

or

```text
incredible-india-explorer/
  index.html              -- Landing page with map, cuisine, festivals, quiz
  app.js                  -- Core application logic (navigation, map, theme, quiz)
  styles.css              -- Global stylesheet (~18k lines)
  pages-common.js         -- Shared logic for newer pages (tribes, coins, rivers)
  pages-common.css        -- Shared styles for newer pages
  router.js               -- SPA routing engine with lifecycle management
  data.js                 -- Map coordinates and state data
  journey.js              -- Bookmark ("My Journey") system
  search-index.js         -- Client-side search index
  auth.js / auth-core.mjs -- Authentication (Firebase + localStorage fallback)
  sw.js                   -- Service Worker with caching strategies
  js-modules/             -- Page-specific lazy-loaded JS modules
  assets/                 -- Images and icons
  states/                 -- Individual state detail pages
  docs/                   -- Additional documentation and test files
  .github/                -- Issue templates, PR template, workflows
```

Loose HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files inside the `frontend` directory are **not allowed**.

### HTML

- Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`).
- Include `aria-label`, `role`, and `alt` attributes for accessibility.
- Use lowercase for tag and attribute names.

### Generated pages

State pages under `dist/frontend/states/` are **generated** from `scripts/layout.html` and
`data.js` — do not hand-edit them. Edit the layout or the data, then run:

```bash
npm run generate        # rewrite dist/frontend/states/
npm run generate:check  # verify the committed output is current (CI runs this)
```

`npm run generate:check` fails if `dist/` has drifted from the layout, so commit
the regenerated files alongside any layout change.

### CSS

- Use CSS custom properties from `:root` in `styles.css` for consistency.
- Follow the existing naming convention: `.kebab-case-classnames`.
- Support both dark (default) and light theme via `.light-theme` on `<body>`.
- Write responsive styles using the existing breakpoints (1024px, 768px, 640px).

### JavaScript

- Use vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks or libraries.
- Prefer `function` declarations over arrow functions for page-level logic.
- Use `const` and `let` (never `var` except when needed for wider scope).
- Expose shared APIs on `window` (e.g., `window.Journey`, `window.ToastNotifier`).
- Wrap modules in IIFE `(function() { ... })()` to avoid polluting global scope.
- Lazy-load page-specific modules via `window.lazyLoadScript()`.
- Handle errors gracefully with `try/catch` and user-facing toast notifications.

### Accessibility

- All interactive elements must be keyboard-accessible.
- Use `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates.
- Maintain focus trapping for modals and overlays using `window.setupFocusTrap()`.
