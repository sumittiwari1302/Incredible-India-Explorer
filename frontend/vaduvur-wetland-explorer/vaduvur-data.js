            "Vaduvur Wetland originated in 1919 as a human-made irrigation tank created to store seasonal floodwaters from the Vennar River—a major distributary of the sacred Cauvery River system. Built to secure water for double-crop paddy farming across the fertile Cauvery Delta, the tank gradually developed into a thriving wetland ecosystem as vegetation and fish populations flourished.",
            "Recognizing its ecological significance as a refuge for thousands of wintering waterfowl, the Government of Tamil Nadu declared Vaduvur Tank a protected Bird Sanctuary under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 in November 1999. In August 2022, its global ecological importance was solidified when UNESCO Ramsar Convention designated Vaduvur Wetland as Ramsar Site No. 2480."

            "As an indispensable stopover on the Central Asian Flyway (CAF), Vaduvur provides vital staging, feeding, and roosting grounds for trans-continental migratory waterfowl travelling from Eurasia, Siberia, Central Asia, and the High Himalayas during the harsh northern winters."

            "Vaduvur is a classic Tamil Nadu 'Eri' (irrigation tank wetland)—a human-modified shallow water body bounded by earthen bunds and fed by canals from the Lower Anicut and Vennar river system. The wetland stores monsoon rainwater, recharging underground aquifers while supplying water to hundreds of hectares of surrounding rice paddies.",
            "To enhance bird habitat, forest authorities planted mounds of Acacia nilotica (Babul) trees within the tank bed. These submerged tree islands create safe nesting platforms insulated from terrestrial predators like jackals and stray dogs, allowing large colonies of storks, pelicans, and cormorants to breed side-by-side with local farming activities."

These aquatic plants oxygenate the water and provide spawning nursery grounds for fish.",
            "The wetland supports a rich ichthyofauna including major carps (Catla catla, Labeo rohita, Cirrhinus mrigala), snakeheads (Channa striata), freshwater catfish (Clarias batrachus), and glassfish. This abundant fish supply sustains thousands of fish-eating birds like Spot-billed Pelicans, Oriental Darters, Kingfishers, and Herons."
