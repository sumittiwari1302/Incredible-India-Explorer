        "Sidhu Murmu was born around 1815 in the village of Bhognadih, in the Santhal Pargana region of the Bengal Presidency (in present-day Jharkhand). He belonged to the Santhal community, an indigenous tribal group of Central-Eastern India.",
        "By the mid-19th century, Santhal communities faced severe exploitation under British colonial land revenue policies, along with abuses from moneylenders (mahajans) and local zamindars, who used debt bondage and land seizures to dispossess Santhal farmers of their land.",
        "In 1855, Sidhu Murmu, along with his brothers Kanhu, Chand, and Bhairav Murmu, called for open rebellion against these oppressive systems, declaring the Santhal Hul (meaning 'revolution' or 'uprising' in the Santhali language). Tens of thousands of Santhals reportedly rose in response, targeting oppressive revenue collectors and moneylenders.",
        "The rebellion was met with a large British military response, and by 1856 it had been suppressed. Sidhu Murmu was captured and executed. Despite its suppression, the Santhal Hul is regarded as a significant and early large-scale organized tribal uprising against British colonial rule, and it directly influenced later colonial administrative reforms in the region."

const SIGNIFICANCE_TEXT = {
    paragraphs: [
        "The Santhal Hul is historically significant as one of the earliest large-scale, organized tribal uprisings against British colonial rule in India, predating the 1857 Rebellion by roughly two years. It demonstrated the capacity for coordinated resistance among indigenous communities facing colonial economic exploitation.",
        "In its aftermath, British authorities created the Santhal Pargana as a distinct administrative division with modified revenue regulations, an acknowledgment of the specific grievances that had driven the uprising. Sidhu Murmu and his brothers are remembered today as important early figures in India's long history of resistance to colonial rule, and their legacy remains especially significant to Santhal and other tribal communities."
