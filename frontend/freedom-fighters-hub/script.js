        biography: 'The Telangana People\'s Struggle was the largest armed peasant uprising of independent India. Against the oppressive rule of the Nizam\'s jagirdars (deshmukhs and deshpandes) and the private Razakar militia, peasants in the Telugu-speaking districts of Hyderabad State rose up in 1946 under the leadership of the Communist Party of India and Andhra Mahasabha. The movement began as a fight against forced labour (vetti), grain levies and land evictions, and grew into a guerrilla war in which peasants seized land and established gram rajya (village governments) across an estimated 3,000 villages. The Razakars retaliated with mass burnings and killings, and the movement reached its peak between 1948 and 1951, ultimately involving hundreds of thousands of peasants before the Indian Army\'s "Operation Polo" and the subsequent military suppression in 1951. It forced land reforms in the region and demonstrated the strength of bottom-up agrarian resistance, and is remembered today as a defining chapter of Telangana\'s history.',
