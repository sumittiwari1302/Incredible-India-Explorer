    paragraphs: [
        "Long before zero was treated as a number in its own right, Indian mathematicians used a placeholder dot (shunya-bindu) within their place-value system to mark an empty position — a concept already present in principle by the time of Pingala's work on prosody around the 3rd century BCE.",
        "The Bakhshali Manuscript, a birch-bark text believed to date to as early as the 3rd century CE, contains some of the earliest known uses of a dot symbol to represent zero within calculations, showing that Indian scholars were already manipulating it as a working placeholder centuries before it was formalized.",
        "The decisive leap came with the astronomer-mathematician Brahmagupta, who in his 628 CE treatise Brahmasphutasiddhanta laid down formal rules for arithmetic with zero — including addition, subtraction, and the effects of multiplying by zero — treating it, for the first time, as a number rather than a mere placeholder.",
        "The oldest securely dated inscription of zero as a circular symbol in a place-value context is found on a stone tablet at the Chaturbhuj Temple in Gwalior, dated to 876 CE. From India, the numeral system carrying zero travelled to the Islamic world through scholars such as Al-Khwarizmi, and from there into Europe, eventually replacing Roman numerals across the world."
