        content: 'Chaturanga takes its name from Sanskrit "chatur" (four) and "anga" (limbs, or divisions), referring to the four divisions of a classical Indian army: infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots. Most historians place its emergence in the Gupta Empire, around the 6th century CE, though the game\'s exact date and inventor remain debated among scholars. The earliest unambiguous literary mention appears in the Harshacharita, a 7th-century biography of Emperor Harsha written by the court poet Banabhatta, where Chaturanga is listed among the pastimes of Indian aristocracy. Some scholars point to even earlier evidence: excavations at Lothal, a port city of the Indus Valley Civilisation in Gujarat, uncovered game pieces resembling chessmen dating to roughly 2450 BCE, though whether these belonged to Chaturanga itself or an unrelated predecessor game is still an open question. Unlike a checkered chessboard, early Chaturanga was played on a plain, uncheckered 8×8 grid called an ashtapada, a board shape likely borrowed from an older race game.'

        content: 'Chaturanga did not just become Western chess. As it travelled along trade and pilgrimage routes, it split into a whole family of related games: Shatranj in Persia and the Arab world, Xiangqi in China, Janggi in Korea, and Shogi in Japan, each adapting the original four-division army concept to local culture and strategy. Chess.com and other modern platforms still trace the lineage explicitly back to Chaturanga in their own histories of the game, and the recognisable shapes of the rook, knight, and bishop remain a direct, physical link to India\'s ancient infantry, cavalry, elephant corps, and chariot divisions, preserved in a hobby played by hundreds of millions of people today.'
