  title: "Mandana Painting",
  region: "Rajasthan",

  tradition: "Wall and floor folk art",

  summary:
    "Mandana is a decorative wall and floor painting tradition practiced by women in the rural villages of Rajasthan. Drawn freehand with white chalk or khariya paste on a red-clay geru background, Mandana designs mark festivals (Diwali, Holi), weddings, harvests, and the birth of a child. The art is seasonal and ephemeral — redrawn on the walls and courtyards of the home for each occasion, then washed away by the next monsoon.",

const HISTORICAL_BACKGROUND = [
  {
    heading: "Origins in Rural Rajasthan",
    body: "Mandana painting is one of the oldest surviving folk-art traditions of Rajasthan, practised for centuries by the women of the Meena tribal community and by rural Rajasthani women more broadly. The word 'Mandana' comes from the Hindi/Sanskrit root 'mandan', meaning 'to decorate' or 'to adorn'. Unlike court painting traditions (such as the Mewar or Marwar schools), Mandana was never a profession — it was a household craft, passed from mother to daughter, created by women for the home.",
  },
  {
    heading: "A Threshold and Wall Tradition",
    body: "Mandana designs are painted on two surfaces: the walls (deewar) and the floors (chowk or aangan) of village homes. The floor designs — drawn in the central courtyard — mark sacred thresholds and are the most ephemeral, redrawn for every festival. The wall designs, often framing doorways and windows, are more elaborate and may survive for months before being repainted.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Ritual Function",
    body: "Mandana is fundamentally a ritual art. The designs are not decorative for their own sake — they invoke protective and auspicious forces. A Mandana drawn at the threshold of the home is believed to ward off the evil eye (nazar) and welcome Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity. Mandana drawn for a wedding invokes fertility and marital blessing; Mandana drawn for the harvest celebrates the grain goddess Annapurna.",
  },
  {
    heading: "The Monsoon Cycle",
    body: "The traditional rhythm of Mandana follows the agricultural year. The most elaborate Mandana are drawn for Diwali (October–November), when every household repaints its walls and courtyards. Holi (March) brings another wave of fresh Mandana. After the monsoon rains of June–September wash away the previous year's designs, the women repaint — a cycle of creation, dissolution, and recreation that has continued for generations.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Modern Recognition",
    body: "Mandana painting began receiving wider academic and artistic attention in the mid-20th century through the work of folklorists and designers who documented the motifs and their meanings. In recent decades, Mandana designs have been adapted onto paper, fabric, and ceramic by contemporary artisans, allowing the tradition to reach urban markets and international audiences. However, the practice of drawing Mandana on village walls is declining as homes shift from mud-plaster to cement plaster, which does not hold the geru-and-khariya medium as well.",
