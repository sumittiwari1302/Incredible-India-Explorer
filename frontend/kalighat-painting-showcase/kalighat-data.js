        title: "Roots at the Kali Ghat",
        period: "Late 18th – Early 19th Century",
        description: "Patua scroll painters migrating from rural Bengal settled along the Hooghly riverbank near the Kalighat temple, beside the sacred ghat that gave the school its name."
    },
    {
        title: "The Pilgrim Trade",
        period: "Mid 19th Century",
        description: "Pilgrims visiting the goddess Kali bought these cheap, quickly-made watercolours as souvenirs. Religious subjects — Kali, Durga, Shiva and the epics — dominated this early phase."
    },
    {
        title: "The Bold Brushwork",
        period: "Late 19th Century",
        description: "Kalighat painters refined a strikingly modern idiom: sweeping single-stroke outlines, tapering brush lines, flat unshaded washes and empty backgrounds — a sharp break from ornate court miniatures."
    },
    {
        title: "Social Satire",
        period: "1870s – 1930s",
        description: "Artists turned their brush on Calcutta's colonial society — the English-educated baboo, the liberated bibi, cunning priests and grasping zamindars — creating India's first school of satirical popular art."
    },
    {
        title: "Decline & Rediscovery",
        period: "1930s – Present",
        description: "Oleographs and photography undercut the hand-painted trade, and the school faded by the 1930s. Today museums worldwide preserve it, and contemporary artists such as Santanu Chakraverty keep the brushwork alive."

const BRUSHWORK_STEPS = [
    { step: 1, title: "One Unbroken Stroke", description: "The painter draws each figure with a single sweep of the brush, never lifting it mid-line — a feat of control that gives the art its electric, immediate energy." },
    { step: 2, title: "Tapering Outlines", description: "Lines swell thick at the shoulder of a figure and die away to a hair-thin point, shaping arms, necks and saris with effortless grace." },
    { step: 3, title: "Flat, Unshaded Washes", description: "Colour is laid in even, unmodulated washes. There is no shading, no perspective — form is built entirely by the outline." },
    { step: 4, title: "Restrained Palette", description: "Black, grey, crimson red, green, yellow and blue dominate, applied against the bare white of cheap mill-made paper." },
    { step: 5, title: "Expressive Faces", description: "Large, heavily-lidded almond eyes, sharply arched brows and finely drawn hands carry the drama of each scene." },
    { step: 6, title: "Empty Backgrounds", description: "Figures float on untouched paper, the emptiness focusing the eye on gesture and expression alone." }

const ARTIST_COMMUNITY = {
    title: "The Patuas of Kalighat & the Living Legacy",
    description: "The painters were village patuas (scroll artists) who turned a temple pilgrimage trade into India's first popular urban art school. Though the original shops closed by the 1930s, Kalighat's bold line now lives on in contemporary studios — carried forward by revivalists such as Santanu Chakraverty, and treasured in collections from the Victoria Memorial to the British Museum and the Cleveland Museum of Art."
