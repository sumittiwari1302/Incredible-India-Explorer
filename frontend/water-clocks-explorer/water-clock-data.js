        "Water clocks, known in India as Ghati Yantra or Kapala Yantra, are among the oldest known timekeeping devices, with references dating back to the Vedic period (c. 1500 BCE). They were essential for scheduling religious rituals (yajnas), which required precise timing.",
        "The most common Indian design used a small hemispherical copper bowl (kapala) with a tiny hole in its base, floated on the surface of a larger vessel filled with water. Water seeped in gradually through the hole, and when the bowl finally filled and sank, it marked the passage of one 'ghati' — roughly 24 minutes.",
        "A person, often a temple attendant called a 'ghatika', would strike a gong or bell each time the bowl sank, announcing the time to the community. This system remained in use in many Indian temples and royal courts well into the 19th century, alongside the spread of mechanical clocks."

const SCIENTIFIC_PRINCIPLES = [
    { title: "Constant Inflow Rate", description: "The hole's fixed diameter combined with near-constant water pressure allowed water to seep in at a predictable rate, making the timing repeatable." },
    { title: "Buoyancy & Displacement", description: "The bowl floats due to buoyant force until enough water enters to make its weight exceed the displaced water's weight, at which point it sinks — a simple, direct application of Archimedes' principle." },
    { title: "Calibration by Volume", description: "Astronomers calibrated the size of the hole and bowl against known solar-day observations, effectively dividing a day into 60 equal ghatis." },
    { title: "Self-Regulating Cycle", description: "Once the bowl sank, it was emptied and re-floated, creating a repeatable, self-resetting cycle that needed no external power source." }
