  summary:
    "Kerala mural painting is a sacred temple art form that flourished from the 9th to the 12th centuries CE. Drawn on the lime-plastered walls of temples and palaces, the murals depict Hindu epics, gods, and goddesses in a distinctive stylised form with bold outlines, flat colours, and a strict palette of five natural pigments (Panchavarna).",

const HISTORICAL_BACKGROUND = [
  {
    heading: "Origins in the Bhakti Movement",
    body: "Kerala mural painting traces its origins to the Bhakti movement that swept through South India between the 8th and 10th centuries CE. The movement emphasised personal devotion to Vishnu and Shiva, and temples became the focal point of community life. The walls of these temples — freshly plastered with lime and sand — became the canvas for narrative depictions of the gods' lives and deeds.",
  },
  {
    heading: "The Golden Age (9th–12th Century)",
    body: "The golden age of Kerala murals was the 9th to 12th century, when the Chera, Ay, and Mushika dynasties patronised temple construction across the Malabar coast. The earliest surviving murals are at the Thirunandikkara Cave Temple (9th century) and the Pundarikapuram Vishnu Temple. Over 500 temple sites with murals have been documented in Kerala, making it one of the densest mural regions in India.",
  },
  {
    heading: "The Panchavarna Palette",
    body: "Kerala murals use a strict five-colour palette called Panchavarna: red (Sindhoora), yellow (Manjal), green (Ilappullu), black (Kari), and white (Safed). Each pigment is derived from natural minerals, roots, or soot, and each colour carries symbolic meaning — red for passion and power, yellow for knowledge and austerity, green for life and nature, black for transcendence, and white for purity.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Stylistic Features",
    body: "Kerala murals are instantly recognisable by their bold, dark outlines; flat, unshaded colour fields; exaggerated eye and hand gestures; and a distinctive forward-bending posture for female figures. The figures are stylised rather than naturalistic, with bodies in complex twisting poses derived from the Natyashastra — the ancient Sanskrit treatise on dance and dramaturgy. The backgrounds are typically flat red or yellow, with no atmospheric perspective.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Decline and Revival",
    body: "The mural tradition declined after the 16th century as temple patronage waned and the Portuguese and Dutch introduced oil painting to the Malabar coast. The murals were neglected for centuries, and many were lost to weather, white-washing, and reconstruction. A revival began in the mid-20th century, led by artist Mammiyoor Krishnankutty Nair and the Guruvayur Devasthanam. Today, the tradition is kept alive by trained mural artists who work on both temple commissions and modern canvas adaptations.",
