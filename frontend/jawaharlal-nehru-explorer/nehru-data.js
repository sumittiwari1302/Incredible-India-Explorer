        "Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad to Motilal Nehru, a wealthy barrister, and Swarup Rani. Raised in a privileged environment at Anand Bhavan, he received private tutoring before traveling to England in 1905 to study at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he earned an honors degree in Natural Science. He subsequently studied law at the Inner Temple and was called to the Bar in 1912.",
        "Returning to India in 1912, Nehru joined the Allahabad High Court bar, but corporate legal practice held little interest for him. Deeply moved by the nationalist fervor sweeping the country, he attended the Bankipore Congress session in 1912 and joined Annie Besant's Home Rule League in 1916. That same year, at the Lucknow Congress, he met Mahatma Gandhi—a meeting that transformed his life and redirected his energies toward the freedom movement.",
        "Under Gandhi's mentorship, Nehru immersed himself in agrarian struggles, leading the Pratapgarh peasant agitation in 1920. His passionate advocacy for anti-imperialism, secularism, and socialism earned him widespread support among young nationalists. Elected INC President at the historic 1929 Lahore Session, Nehru drafted the pledge of Purna Swaraj (Complete Independence), replacing Dominion status as the nation's goal.",
        "Following Independence on 15 August 1947, Nehru served as India's first Prime Minister until his death in 1964. He championed parliamentary democracy, secularism, scientific temper, state-led industrial planning, established world-class educational institutions like IITs, AIIMS, and ISRO (INCOSPAR), and formulated India's non-aligned foreign policy."
