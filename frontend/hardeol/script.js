    overview: {
        geography: "Mount Hardeol (Sanskrit: 'Temple of God', also 'Trishuli South') is the highest peak on the northern side of the ring of peaks that guard the Nanda Devi Sanctuary, perched at its northeast corner. It lies at the northern end of the Milam valley in the Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand, just south of Trishuli and north of Rishi Pahar, on a north–south trending ridge that leads toward Nanda Devi East.",
        significance: "After a reconnaissance in 1939 and serious attempts starting in 1967, Hardeol was first summitted on 31 May 1978 by an Indo-Tibetan Border Police expedition led by S. P. Mulasi, climbing the ridge connecting the peak to Trishuli. Only one further ascent is recorded in the Himalayan Index — a Border Security Force expedition that placed five climbers on the summit on 24 September 1991.",
        climbingCharacter: "Hardeol is a formidable, technical high-altitude objective requiring Indian Mountaineering Foundation permits, glacier travel through the Ikualari glacier and Hardeol icefall, expert ice-craft, crevasse-rescue skills, and rigorous acclimatisation. The best approach is from the east, via the Ikualari glacier into the Trishuli valley. Locals of the Johar valley call it Hardoli and worship it as their presiding mountain deity."
