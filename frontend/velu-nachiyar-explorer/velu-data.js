        "Velu Nachiyar was born in 1730 to the royal family of Ramnad and was trained in warfare, horse riding, archery, and multiple languages from a young age. She was married to Muthuvaduganathaperiya Udaiyathevar, the ruler of Sivaganga.",
        "In 1772, her husband was killed in battle against combined forces of the British East India Company and the Nawab of Arcot, and Sivaganga fell under their control. Velu Nachiyar fled with her daughter and took refuge under the protection of Hyder Ali, ruler of Mysore, at Virupachi near Dindigul for about eight years.",
        "During her years in exile, she worked to build alliances and raise a fighting force, gathering support from regional allies. In 1780, Velu Nachiyar led a successful military campaign to reclaim the kingdom of Sivaganga from the East India Company's control, ruling for several years afterward.",
        "She is remembered as one of the earliest Indian rulers to organize armed resistance against the East India Company, decades before the wider uprisings of the mid-19th century, and is honored today with the title 'Veeramangai,' meaning 'brave woman.'"
