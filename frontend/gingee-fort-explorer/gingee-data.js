Renowned for its natural steep cliffs, drawbridge over a 60-foot deep chasm, 7-story Kalyana Mahal, and multi-layered granaries, it earned the title 'Troy of the East' from the British. Throughout history, it served as a contested regional seat for the Konar dynasty, Vijayanagara Nayaks, Bijapur Sultanate, Maratha Empire, Mughals, Carnatic Nawabs, French, and British forces."

In 1677, Maratha Emperor Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj captured the fort, fortifying its ramparts further. During the late 17th century, Gingee served as the capital of the Maratha Empire under Rajaram I, withstanding an extraordinary 8-year siege (1690–1698 CE) by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb's general Zulfiqar Khan. In 1714 CE, the heroic 22-year-old Bundela prince Raja Desingu (Tej Singh) fought valiantly against the Nawab of Arcot, cementing Gingee's place in Tamil folklore."
