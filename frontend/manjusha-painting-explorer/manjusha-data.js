Refusing to accept her fate, the merchant's daughter carried his body on a raft down the Ganga through the long night, singing and offering worship, until the goddess relented and restored him to life. Her unshakeable devotion is the soul of every Manjusha painting."

        story: "During the month of Shravan, families of the Anga region create Manjusha paintings and display them on ritual caskets to honour Bishari — locally known as Manasa Devi — seeking her protection from snakes and her blessings for the home. The paintings are created anew each season, keeping the tradition alive year after year."
