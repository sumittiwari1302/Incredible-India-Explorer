  summary:
    "Sohrai is a ceremonial wall and floor painting tradition practiced by the tribal women of Jharkhand during the Sohrai harvest festival in November. Named after the Sohrai sowing festival, the paintings celebrate cattle — the backbone of the agrarian tribal economy — and are drawn with natural earth pigments on the mud walls of village homes. The art form received a Geographical Indication (GI) tag in 2019.",

const HISTORICAL_BACKGROUND = [
  {
    heading: "Origins in the Forests of Chota Nagpur",
    body: "Sohrai painting traces its origins to the forested Chota Nagpur Plateau of eastern India, home to the Kurmi, Santhal, Munda, and Oraon tribal communities. The art is inextricably tied to the Sohrai festival, a cattle-harvest celebration held in late November after the paddy harvest. The word 'Sohrai' is believed to derive from the Paleolithic cave art tradition of the region — rock paintings in the nearby Isko caves bear striking visual similarity to modern Sohrai motifs.",
  },
  {
    heading: "A Cattle Festival",
    body: "The Sohrai festival honours cattle — particularly the bull and the cow — which are the foundation of tribal agrarian life. On Sohrai day, cattle are bathed, anointed with oil and vermillion, and fed special rice. The walls of the cattle shed and the home are freshly plastered with mud and then painted with Sohrai motifs depicting cattle, elephants, peacocks, and the Tree of Life. The paintings are an offering of gratitude for the harvest and a prayer for continued fertility.",
  },
  {
    heading: "A Women's Tradition",
    body: "Sohrai is exclusively practiced by women. Mothers pass the tradition to daughters through observation and practice — there is no formal training, no written manual, and no preparatory sketch. The women paint freehand, using fingers, chewed twigs, and cloth rags. The art is ephemeral: it is painted fresh each year on the mud walls, and the monsoon rains of the following summer wash it away, beginning the cycle again.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Visual Roots in Prehistory",
    body: "Art historians have noted the striking visual continuity between Sohrai painting and the prehistoric rock art of the Chota Nagpur region. The rock paintings at Isko, Satpahar, and Thetangi — some dating back over 10,000 years — depict the same cattle, elephants, and hunting scenes that appear in modern Sohrai art. Sohrai painting is one of the few living folk-art traditions that retains a direct visual link to the Mesolithic and Chalcolithic rock art of India.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Modern Recognition",
    body: "Sohrai painting was awarded a Geographical Indication (GI) tag in 2019, recognising it as a distinctive cultural product of Jharkhand. In recent years, the art form has been adapted onto paper and canvas by tribal women artists, allowing it to reach urban and international markets. Government initiatives and NGOs have supported training programs to ensure the tradition continues despite the increasing shift from mud-plaster to brick-and-cement homes in rural Jharkhand.",
