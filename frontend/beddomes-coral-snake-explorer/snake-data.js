    overview: "Beddome's Coral Snake (Calliophis beddomei) is a small, highly secretive venomous snake endemic to the tropical wet evergreen and montane shola forests of the Southern Western Ghats.",
    distributionAndHabitat: "Restricted to wet evergreen forest floors and moist leaf litter layers at altitudes between 600m to 1,500m in Tamil Nadu (Nilgiris, Anamalai), Kerala (Wayanad, Agasthyamalai), and Karnataka.",
    behaviour: "Primarily nocturnal and fossorial (burrowing). When threatened, it coils its body tightly and displays its brilliant coral-pink underbelly as an aposematic warning signal while keeping its head hidden beneath coils.",
    diet: "Ophiophagous specialist feeding almost exclusively on small subterranean snakes (Uropeltids / shieldtail snakes, blind snakes Typhlopidae) and leaf-litter skinks.",
    reproduction: "Oviparous species; females lay small clutches of 2 to 4 elongated eggs under damp rotting logs or subterranean burrows during late monsoon.",
    threatsAndConservation: "Threatened by deforestation, cardamom and tea plantation expansion, leaf-litter clearing, forest fires, and road mortality across Western Ghat hill ranges.",
    ecologicalImportance: "Serves as an essential mid-trophic predator regulating fossorial reptile populations and functioning as a sensitive bioindicator of pristine forest soil moisture.",
    interestingFacts: [
        "Features a striking ventral color pattern of bright coral-red to reddish-pink scales.",
        "Possesses elongated venom glands extending far backward into the body cavity.",
        "Named in honor of Richard Henry Beddome, former Chief Conservator of Forests in Madras Presidency who documented Indian herpetofauna.",
        "Extremely docile and non-aggressive; bites to humans are virtually unrecorded due to its secretive leaf-burrowing habits."
