    title: "The World's First Industrial Zinc Production",
    paragraphs: [
        "Zinc is uniquely difficult to smelt using conventional methods: at the temperature needed to reduce zinc oxide to metal, zinc itself is already a vapor. Any smelter using an open furnace, like those used for iron or copper, would simply lose the zinc as gas into the air. Solving this problem required an entirely different approach — distillation.",
        "At Zawar, in present-day Rajasthan, archaeological and metallurgical evidence shows that Indian metalworkers were smelting zinc ore on an industrial scale by at least the 12th century CE, building on ore-roasting and smelting traditions in the region that reach back centuries earlier. Zawar is widely regarded by historians of metallurgy as the site of the world's earliest large-scale zinc production.",
        "The breakthrough was the 'downward distillation' technique: ore was packed into sealed clay retorts with a narrow condenser tube pointing downward into a collection vessel buried in the ground below. As the retort was heated, zinc vapor was driven off, traveled down the tube away from the open air and its oxygen, and condensed into liquid metal in the cooler chamber beneath — a design that prevented the vapor from re-oxidizing before it could be captured.",
        "Thousands of discarded retorts found at Zawar attest to a sustained, large-scale industry that supplied zinc metal used across India and, via trade networks, well beyond it, centuries before comparable distillation processes appeared in Europe."

        title: "1. Charging the Retort",
        description: "Crushed zinc ore, mixed with an organic reducing agent, is packed into a sealed, bottle-shaped fireclay retort with a narrow-necked condenser tube fitted at its base."
    },
    {
        title: "2. Furnace Heating",
        description: "Rows of retorts are stacked mouth-down in a furnace and heated to roughly 1,000°C — hot enough to reduce zinc oxide to metal, which immediately vaporizes at this temperature."
    },
    {
        title: "3. Downward Vapor Flow",
        description: "Because the condenser tube points downward and away from open air, the zinc vapor is forced away from atmospheric oxygen instead of escaping upward and burning off, as it would in an open furnace."
    },
    {
        title: "4. Condensation & Collection",
        description: "The vapor travels down into a cooler clay condenser vessel buried below the furnace, where it condenses back into liquid zinc metal and is collected once the process is complete."
    }

const SCIENTIFIC_PRINCIPLES = [
    { title: "Boiling Point Below Reduction Temperature", description: "Zinc boils at 907°C, well below the ~1,200°C needed for some other metal smelting — meaning zinc is a vapor the instant it is reduced, unlike iron or copper which stay solid or liquid." },
    { title: "Oxidation Avoidance", description: "Zinc vapor reacts almost instantly with atmospheric oxygen to reform zinc oxide. Directing the vapor downward, away from air, was essential to capturing metallic zinc rather than losing it as smoke." },
    { title: "Sealed Retort Design", description: "The airtight, bottle-shaped retort kept the reducing atmosphere inside contained, preventing oxygen from re-entering and interrupting the reduction reaction." },
    { title: "Controlled Condensation", description: "A cooler condensation zone, physically separated from the hot reaction zone, allowed the vapor to cool below 907°C and solidify into usable metal." }
