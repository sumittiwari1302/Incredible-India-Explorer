        "Ram Prasad Bismil was born on 11 June 1897 in Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh to Muralidhar and Moolmati. Deeply influenced by Swami Dayananda Saraswati's 'Satyarth Prakash' and the Arya Samaj movement, Bismil developed an early passion for Hindi literature, poetry, and social reform. The martyrdom of Ghadar party leaders and Bhai Parmanand's arrest ignited his revolutionary zeal, leading him to found the secret society 'Matrivedi' in 1915.",
        "In 1918, Bismil organized the Mainpuri Conspiracy, publishing banned patriotic literature like 'Desh Vasiyon Ke Naam Sandesh'. When British authorities launched raids, Bismil escaped arrest by living underground in the Yamuna riverbank forests for over two years, working disguised as a farmer while continuing to write revolutionary poems.",
        "In 1924, along with Sachindra Nath Sanyal and Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee, Bismil co-founded the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) at Kanpur. As the leader of HRA's military wing, Bismil sought to establish a democratic Federal Republic of the United States of India through armed struggle against British colonial rule.",
        "On 9 August 1925, Bismil executed the legendary Kakori Train Action, seizing colonial treasury funds near Lucknow. Arrested shortly after, Bismil faced the famous Kakori Trial. While on death row at Gorakhpur Jail, he penned his immortal autobiography 'Atmakatha' before walking courageously to the gallows on 19 December 1927, chanting 'Vande Mataram'."
