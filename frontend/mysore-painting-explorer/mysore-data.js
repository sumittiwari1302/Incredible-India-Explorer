        "Mysore Painting traces its origins to the 14th century Vijayanagara Empire. Following the battle of Talikota in 1565 CE, skilled artists of the Chitragara community migrated to Seringapatam (Srirangapatna) and Mysore under the royal patronage of Raja Wodeyar I (1578–1617 CE), laying the foundation of the distinct Mysore school of art.",
        "The golden age of Mysore Painting arrived under Maharaja Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar III (1794–1868 CE). A great patron of arts and literature, the Maharaja commissioned hundreds of paintings, murals on the walls of Jaganmohan Palace, and the monumental 9-volume iconographic treatise titled 'Sritattvanidhi', which standardized the iconography, colors, and postures of Hindu deities.",
        "Mysore paintings are renowned for their elegance, muted colors, soft facial expressions, and sophisticated low-relief gold foil embossing. Unlike Tanjore paintings, which use heavy gesso with glass beads and precious stones, Mysore paintings feature delicate, subtle gesso work that gives the artwork a silky, understated grandeur."
