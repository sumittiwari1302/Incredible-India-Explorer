        "Standing in the Qutb Complex in Mehrauli, Delhi, the Iron Pillar is a single, solid shaft of wrought iron roughly 7.2 meters tall and weighing about six tonnes. A Sanskrit inscription on the pillar credits it to a king referred to as 'Chandra', widely identified by historians with the Gupta emperor Chandragupta II, dating the pillar to around the 4th to 5th century CE.",
        "The pillar is believed to have originally served as a flagstaff, likely topped with an image of Garuda, and may have stood elsewhere before being relocated to its current site in Delhi, possibly during the reign of the Tomara dynasty in the 11th century CE.",
        "What has fascinated metallurgists and engineers for over a century is not just its age or craftsmanship, but its condition: after more than 1,600 years exposed to Delhi's weather, the pillar shows only minor surface corrosion, with no significant structural rusting — an extraordinary feat for a large iron object of its age, especially one produced without any of the alloying techniques used in modern stainless steel.",
        "The pillar has been studied extensively since the 20th century, with detailed metallurgical analysis in the late 1990s and early 2000s finally providing a widely accepted scientific explanation for its resistance to rust."

        ordinaryDescription: "Rust continues to flake off and re-form in cycles, progressively thinning the iron and weakening its structure.",
        pillarDescription: "The misawite layer thickens and bonds tightly to the metal surface, acting as a passive barrier that slows further oxygen and moisture penetration dramatically."

        title: "Present Day",
        ordinaryDescription: "Unprotected iron of this age exposed to the elements would typically be almost entirely consumed by rust or structurally destroyed.",
